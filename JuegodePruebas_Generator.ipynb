        "## Introduction\n",
        "This Colab notebook demonstrates a Python script designed to generate a dataset of products, including attributes such as prices, descriptions, similarities between products, and their arrangement on a shelf. The generated data is saved in a CSV file, adhering to a predefined format.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "- **User Input**: The script allows user input for customizing the number of products to generate, as well as the number of rows and columns used to organize products on a virtual shelf.\n",
        "- **Product Generation**: Each product has a consistent price (12.0) and a descriptive label, with names generated sequentially (e.g., Product1, Product2).\n",
        "- **Random Similarities**: The script randomly assigns a similarity score between 0.01 and 0.99 for each unique product pair, ensuring valid similarity values \\(0 < similarity < 1\\).\n",
        "- **CSV Output**: The final data is written to a CSV file in three sections: product data, similarity values, and shelf arrangement.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Use\n",
        "1. Enter the number of products you wish to generate (within a range of 1-10000).\n",
        "2. Specify the number of rows and columns for product arrangement on a shelf (both within a range of 1-100).\n",
        "3. The generated CSV file will be saved and can be downloaded for further analysis or visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Running the Script\n",
        "Below, you can find and execute the script to see how it works:\n",
